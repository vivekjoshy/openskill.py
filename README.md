## Description

![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/openskill) ![Conda (channel only)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openskill/badges/version.svg) ![PyPI - Implementation](https://img.shields.io/pypi/implementation/openskill)

In the multifaceted world of online gaming, an accurate multiplayer rating system plays a crucial role. A multiplayer rating system measures and compares players' skill levels in competitive games to ensure balanced match-making, boosting overall gaming experiences. Currently, TrueSkill by Microsoft Research is a notable rating system, but gaming communities are yearning for faster, more adaptable alternatives.

Here are *some*, but not all, of the reasons you should drop TrueSkill
and bury Elo once and for all:

- Multiplayer.
- Multifaction.
- Asymmetric faction size.
- Predict Win, Draw and Rank Outcomes.
- Per Player Weights
- Partial Play
- 150% faster than TrueSkill.
- 100% Pure Python.
- 100% Test Coverage.
- CPython and PyPy Support.
- 5 Separate Models.
- Fine-grained control of mathematical constants.
- Open License
- Accuracy on par with TrueSkill.


## Installation
```shell
pip install openskill
```

## Usage

The official documentation is hosted [here](https://openskill.me/en/stable/).
Please refer to it for details on how to use this library.

### Limited Example

```python
>>> from openskill.models import PlackettLuce
>>> model = PlackettLuce()
>>> model.rating()
PlackettLuceRating(mu=25.0, sigma=8.333333333333334)
>>> r = model.rating
>>> [[a, b], [x, y]] = [[r(), r()], [r(), r()]]
>>> [[a, b], [x, y]] = model.rate([[a, b], [x, y]])
>>> a
PlackettLuceRating(mu=26.964294621803063, sigma=8.177962604389991)
>>> x
PlackettLuceRating(mu=23.035705378196937, sigma=8.177962604389991)
>>> (a == b) and (x == y)
True
```

Openskill 2.3.0 (2022-05-14)
============================

Features
--------

- Add support for python 3.7+ (`#52 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/52>`_)


Openskill 2.2.0 (2022-03-18)
============================

Features
--------

- ``tau`` (defaults to 0): Additive dynamics factor, which keeps a player's rating from getting stuck at a level. Normally, a player's sigma will only decrease as we gain more information about their performance. This option will put some pressure on this back up. This default will change to be sigma/100 with v3, to be more congruent with TrueSkill, but higher may make your rating system more exciting. (`#50 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/50>`_)

- ``prevent_sigma_increase`` (defaults to ``False``): for a tau > 0, it is possible that a player could play someone with a low enough rating that even if they win, their ordinal rating will still go down slightly. If your players have no agency in matchmaking, it is not desirable to have a situation where a player goes down on the leaderboard even though they win. (`#50 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/50>`_)


Openskill 2.1.0 (2022-03-10)

- Changes ``ordinal`` to accept both ``Rating`` objects and lists or tuples of 2 floats. (`#46 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/46>`_)


Features
--------

- Add a function to predict draws. (`#45 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/45>`_)
- ``create_rating`` now checks if the argument is the correct type. (`#46 <https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py/issues/46>`_)

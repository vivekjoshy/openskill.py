Canonical API
=============

If you wish to contribute to the OpenSkill project, you will need to
use the internal API. Every function and method including, private
ones are documented unless it's obvious what they do. For instance
we make no effort to document some __dunder__ methods.


.. warning::

   This is the full internal API documentation. All private
   methods are visible. In addition, no guarantees are made
   about the private methods displayed here. They may change
   at any time without warning.

.. py:class:: BradleyTerryPart(mu = 25.0, sigma = 25.0 / 3.0, beta = 25.0 / 6.0, kappa = 0.0001, gamma = _gamma, tau = 25.0 / 300.0, limit_sigma = False, balance = False)


   Algorithm 2 by :cite:t:`JMLR:v12:weng11a`

   The BradleyTerryPart model maintains the single scalar value
   representation of player performance, enables rating updates based on
   match outcomes, and utilizes a logistic regression approach for rating
   estimation. By allowing for partial pairing situations, this model
   caters to scenarios where not all players face each other directly and
   still provides accurate rating estimates.

   :param mu: Represents the initial belief about the skill of
              a player before any matches have been played. Known
              mostly as the mean of the Guassian prior distribution.

                 variance of the skill of a player.

    The Thurstone-Mosteller with Partial Pairing model extends the full
    pairing model to handle scenarios where not all players compete against
    each other. It retains the assumptions of the full pairing modelâ€”utilizing
    a single scalar value to represent player performance, enabling rating
    updates through match outcomes, and employing maximum likelihood
    estimation for rating estimation. This model relaxes the requirement
    for complete pairing and is ideal for situations where only specific
    players directly compete with each other.

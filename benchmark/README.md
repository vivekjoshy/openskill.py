Run the respective Jupyter Notebook files with a compatible Python version and choose the options.

## Available Benchmarks

### Local

- ``benchmark.py``: Performs k-fold cross-validation to compare models.
- ``win.ipynb``: Compares win performance against TrueSkill.
- ``draw.ipynb``: Predicts draws on standard chess matches.
- ``rank.ipynb``: Uses rank prediction on a large dataset.

### Kaggle

- [OpenSkill - Weights Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/code/daegontaven/openskill-weights-benchmark): A benchmark on CS:GO matches using the weights feature.

Note: The rank benchmark downloads a large file (around 1 GB) and requires slightly more RAM (>12GB) if running locally.
